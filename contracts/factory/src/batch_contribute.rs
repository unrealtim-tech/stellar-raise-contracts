//! # batch_contribute
//!
//! @title   BatchContribute — gas-efficient multi-campaign contribution helper.
//!
//! @notice  Allows a single contributor to fund multiple campaigns in one
//!          transaction, avoiding the per-transaction overhead of N separate
//!          calls.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! ### Bounded input
//! `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` caps the number of campaigns per call.  Unbounded loops
//! over caller-supplied arrays are a gas-exhaustion vector; the cap keeps
//! worst-case gas predictable and prevents accidental or malicious oversized
//! batches.
//!
//! ### Fail-fast vs. best-effort
//! The batch uses fail-fast semantics: if any single `contribute` call
//! returns an error the entire batch panics.  This is safer than
//! best-effort (silently skipping failures) because it prevents partial
//! state where the contributor paid for some campaigns but not others
//! without knowing which ones failed.
//!
//! ### No on-chain campaign registry loop
//! The caller supplies the exact campaign addresses.  The factory never
//! iterates over its full `Campaigns` vec on-chain — that list is for
//! off-chain indexers only.
//!
//! ### Mapping-style lookup
//! Per-campaign state (contributions, contributors) is keyed by
//! `DataKey::Contribution(address)` — a typed map — so reads are O(1)
//! regardless of how many campaigns exist.
//!
//! ## Security Assumptions
//! 1. `contributor.require_auth()` is enforced once here; each downstream
//!    `contribute()` call also enforces it via the crowdfund contract.
//! 2. Batch size is capped at `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` to bound gas consumption.
//! 3. Zero-amount entries are rejected before any cross-contract call.
