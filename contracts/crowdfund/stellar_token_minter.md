# stellar_token_minter — Crowdfund Contract

Technical reference for the Stellar Raise crowdfund smart contract built with Soroban SDK 22.

---

## Overview

The crowdfund contract manages a single campaign lifecycle:

```
Active → Successful  (goal met, creator withdraws)
Active → Refunded    (deadline passed, goal not met)
Active → Cancelled   (creator cancels early)
```

All token amounts are in the token's smallest unit (stroops for XLM).

---

## Logging Bounds

Soroban contracts run inside a metered host environment. Every event emission
and every storage read/write consumes CPU and memory instructions. Unbounded
iteration over contributor or pledger lists creates a denial-of-service vector:
a campaign with thousands of contributors could make `withdraw` or
`collect_pledges` exceed per-transaction resource limits and become permanently
un-callable.

The `stellar_token_minter` module centralises all bound-checking logic.

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX` | 100 | Total events emitted in one transaction |
| `MAX_MINT_BATCH` | 50 | NFT mints per `withdraw` call |
| `MAX_LOG_ENTRIES` | 200 | Diagnostic log entries per transaction |

### Helper Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `within_event_budget(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX` |
| `within_mint_batch(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_MINT_BATCH` |
| `within_log_budget(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_LOG_ENTRIES` |
| `remaining_event_budget(reserved)` | Events remaining before budget exhausted |
| `remaining_mint_budget(minted)` | NFT mints remaining in current batch |
| `emit_batch_summary(env, topic, count, emitted)` | Emits a single summary event; no-op when `count == 0` or budget exhausted |

### Design Rationale

- Limits are enforced **before** the loop that would exceed them, not after.
- All arithmetic uses `saturating_sub` / `checked_*` to prevent overflow.
- No limit can be bypassed by the caller — they are compile-time constants.
- `emit_batch_summary` replaces per-item events with a single count event,
  keeping event volume O(1) regardless of list size.

## Contract Functions

### `initialize`

```rust
fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    creator: Address,
    token: Address,
    goal: i128,
    deadline: u64,
    min_contribution: i128,
    platform_config: Option<PlatformConfig>,
    bonus_goal: Option<i128>,
    bonus_goal_description: Option<String>,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Creates a new campaign. Can only be called once.

- `admin` — stored for `upgrade` authorization.
- `creator` — must sign the transaction (`require_auth`).
- `platform_config` — optional fee recipient; `fee_bps` must be ≤ 10,000.
- `bonus_goal` — must be strictly greater than `goal`.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized`  
**Panics:** platform fee > 100%, bonus goal ≤ primary goal

---

### `contribute`

```rust
fn contribute(env: Env, contributor: Address, amount: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Transfers `amount` tokens from `contributor` to the contract. Contributor must sign.

- Rejects `amount == 0` → `ZeroAmount`.
- Rejects amounts below `min_contribution` → `BelowMinimum`.
- Rejects contributions after `deadline` → `CampaignEnded`.
- Uses `checked_add` on `total_raised` → `Overflow` on failure.
- Emits `("campaign", "contributed")` event.
- Fires `("campaign", "bonus_goal_reached")` **once** when `total_raised` crosses `bonus_goal`.

**Errors:** `CampaignEnded`, `ZeroAmount`, `BelowMinimum`, `Overflow`

---

### `pledge`

```rust
fn pledge(env: Env, pledger: Address, amount: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Records a pledge without transferring tokens. Tokens are collected later via `collect_pledges`.

**Errors:** `CampaignEnded`

---

### `collect_pledges`

```rust
fn collect_pledges(env: Env) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Pulls tokens from all pledgers after the deadline when the combined total meets
the goal. Each pledger must have pre-authorized the transfer. Emits a single
`("campaign", "pledges_collected")` summary event.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalNotReached`

---

### `withdraw`

```rust
fn withdraw(env: Env) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Creator claims raised funds after deadline when goal is met. If a
`PlatformConfig` is set, the fee is deducted first. If an NFT contract is
configured, mints up to `MAX_MINT_BATCH` NFTs (one per contributor). Emits a
single `("campaign", "nft_batch_minted")` summary event instead of one event
per contributor.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalNotReached`

---

### `refund`

```rust
fn refund(env: Env) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Returns all contributions when the deadline has passed and the goal was not met.

> **Deprecated** as of contract v3. Use `refund_single` instead.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalReached`

---

### `refund_single`

```rust
fn refund_single(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Pull-based refund for a single contributor. Preferred over `refund` for gas
safety with large contributor lists.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalReached`, `NothingToRefund`

---

### `cancel`

```rust
fn cancel(env: Env)
```

Creator cancels the campaign early. Sets status to `Cancelled`.

**Panics:** not active, not authorized

---

### `upgrade`

```rust
fn upgrade(env: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>)
```

Replaces the contract WASM without changing its address or storage. Only the
`admin` set at initialization can call this.

---

### `update_metadata`

```rust
fn update_metadata(
    env: Env,
    creator: Address,
    title: Option<String>,
    description: Option<String>,
    socials: Option<String>,
)
```

Updates campaign metadata. Only callable by the creator while `Active`. Pass
`None` to leave a field unchanged.

---

### `set_nft_contract`

```rust
fn set_nft_contract(env: Env, creator: Address, nft_contract: Address)
```

Configures the NFT contract used for contributor reward minting on successful
withdrawal. Only the creator can call this.

---

### `add_stretch_goal` / `add_roadmap_item`

```rust
fn add_stretch_goal(env: Env, milestone: i128)
fn add_roadmap_item(env: Env, date: u64, description: String)
```

Append stretch goals and roadmap items. Creator-only.

| 5 | `GoalReached` | Refund attempted when goal was met |

## Testing and Security Notes

- Test coverage target remains 95%+ lines in the crowdfund module.
- Critical code paths covered:
  - `initialize`: repeated init, platform fee bounds, bonus goal guard.
  - `contribute`: minimum amount guard, deadline guard, aggregation, overflow protection.
  - `pledge` / `collect_pledges`: state transition and transfer effect.
  - `withdraw`: deadline, goal check, platform fee, NFT mint flow.
  - `refund`, `cancel`, `add_roadmap_item`, `add_stretch_goal`, `current_milestone`, `get_stats`, `bonus_goal`.
  - `upgrade`: admin-only authorization.
  - `stellar_token_minter.test.rs`: explicit security/readability tests for
    deadline guards, goal guards, bonus-goal capping, and upgrade auth.

### Security assumptions

1. `creator.require_auth()` and `admin.require_auth()` provide access control in relevant calls.
2. `platform fee <= 10_000` ensures no more than 100% fees are taken.
3. `bonus_goal` strict comparison (`> goal`) prevents invalid secondary goal loops.
4. `contribute` and `collect_pledges` use `checked_add`/`checked_mul` to avoid overflow in numeric operations.
5. `status` checks in state-transition functions prevent replay / double accounting.

| 6 | `Overflow` | Integer overflow in contribution accounting |
| 7 | `NothingToRefund` | Caller has no contribution to refund |
| 8 | `ZeroAmount` | Contribution amount is zero |
| 9 | `BelowMinimum` | Contribution below `min_contribution` |
| 10 | `CampaignNotActive` | Campaign is not in `Active` status |

## Events

| Topic | Data | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `("campaign", "contributed")` | `(contributor, amount)` | `contribute` |
| `("campaign", "pledged")` | `(pledger, amount)` | `pledge` |
| `("campaign", "pledges_collected")` | `total_pledged` | `collect_pledges` |
| `("campaign", "bonus_goal_reached")` | `bonus_goal` | `contribute` (once) |
| `("campaign", "withdrawn")` | `(creator, payout, nft_count)` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "fee_transferred")` | `(platform_addr, fee)` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "nft_batch_minted")` | `minted_count` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "roadmap_item_added")` | `(date, description)` | `add_roadmap_item` |
| `("metadata_updated", creator)` | `Vec<Symbol>` of updated fields | `update_metadata` |

---

## Security Assumptions

1. `creator.require_auth()` and `admin.require_auth()` provide access control.
2. Platform fee is validated ≤ 10,000 bps (100%) at initialization.
3. Bonus goal must exceed primary goal — validated at initialization.
4. `contribute` uses `checked_add` on all numeric accumulation → `Overflow` error.
5. NFT mint loop breaks at `MAX_MINT_BATCH` — caps event emission and gas.
6. `emit_batch_summary` is a no-op when `count == 0` or budget exhausted.
7. Refunds use checks-effects-interactions: storage zeroed before token transfer.
8. No reentrancy surface: Soroban's execution model does not support reentrancy.
