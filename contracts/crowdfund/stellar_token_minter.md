# stellar_token_minter — Crowdfund Contract Security Module

Technical reference for the Stellar Raise crowdfund smart contract security module built with Soroban SDK.

---

## Overview

The `stellar_token_minter` module provides secure token minting and pledge collection functionality for the Stellar Raise crowdfunding platform. This module contains validation functions and security checks that are used internally by the crowdfund contract.

---

## Logging Bounds

Soroban contracts run inside a metered host environment. Every event emission
and every storage read/write consumes CPU and memory instructions. Unbounded
iteration over contributor or pledger lists creates a denial-of-service vector:
a campaign with thousands of contributors could make `withdraw` or
`collect_pledges` exceed per-transaction resource limits and become permanently
un-callable.

The `stellar_token_minter` module centralises all bound-checking logic.

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX` | 100 | Total events emitted in one transaction |
| `MAX_MINT_BATCH` | 50 | NFT mints per `withdraw` call |
| `MAX_LOG_ENTRIES` | 200 | Diagnostic log entries per transaction |

### Helper Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `within_event_budget(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_EVENTS_PER_TX` |
| `within_mint_batch(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_MINT_BATCH` |
| `within_log_budget(count)` | `true` when `count < MAX_LOG_ENTRIES` |
| `remaining_event_budget(reserved)` | Events remaining before budget exhausted |
| `remaining_mint_budget(minted)` | NFT mints remaining in current batch |
| `emit_batch_summary(env, topic, count, emitted)` | Emits a single summary event; no-op when `count == 0` or budget exhausted |

### Design Rationale

- Limits are enforced **before** the loop that would exceed them, not after.
- All arithmetic uses `saturating_sub` / `checked_*` to prevent overflow.
- No limit can be bypassed by the caller — they are compile-time constants.
- `emit_batch_summary` replaces per-item events with a single count event,
  keeping event volume O(1) regardless of list size.

## Contract Functions

#### `validate_pledge_preconditions`

```rust
pub fn validate_pledge_preconditions(
    env: &Env,
    amount: i128,
    min_contribution: i128,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Validates preconditions for pledge operations.

**Security Checks:**
1. Campaign must be active (`CampaignNotActive` if not)
2. Amount must be non-zero (`ZeroAmount` if zero)
3. Amount must meet minimum (`BelowMinimum` if below)
4. Current time must be before deadline (`CampaignEnded` if past)

**Validation Order:** Status → Amount → Deadline (prevents timing-based attacks)

#### `validate_collect_preconditions`

```rust
pub fn validate_collect_preconditions(
    env: &Env,
) -> Result<(i128, i128, i128), ContractError>
```

Validates preconditions for collect_pledges operations.

- Rejects `amount == 0` → `ZeroAmount`.
- Rejects amounts below `min_contribution` → `BelowMinimum`.
- Rejects contributions after `deadline` → `CampaignEnded`.
- Uses `checked_add` on `total_raised` → `Overflow` on failure.
- Emits `("campaign", "contributed")` event.
- Fires `("campaign", "bonus_goal_reached")` **once** when `total_raised` crosses `bonus_goal`.

**Errors:** `CampaignEnded`, `ZeroAmount`, `BelowMinimum`, `Overflow`

### Arithmetic Helper Functions

#### `calculate_total_commitment`

```rust
pub fn calculate_total_commitment(
    total_raised: i128,
    total_pledged: i128,
) -> Result<i128, ContractError>
```

Safely calculates the total commitment (raised + pledged).

- Uses `checked_add` to prevent overflow
- Returns `ContractError::Overflow` if addition would overflow

#### `safe_add_pledge`

```rust
pub fn safe_add_pledge(
    current_total: i128,
    new_amount: i128,
) -> Result<i128, ContractError>
```

Pulls tokens from all pledgers after the deadline when the combined total meets
the goal. Each pledger must have pre-authorized the transfer. Emits a single
`("campaign", "pledges_collected")` summary event.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalNotReached`

---

#### `validate_contribution_amount`

```rust
pub fn validate_contribution_amount(
    amount: i128,
    min_contribution: i128,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Creator claims raised funds after deadline when goal is met. If a
`PlatformConfig` is set, the fee is deducted first. If an NFT contract is
configured, mints up to `MAX_MINT_BATCH` NFTs (one per contributor). Emits a
single `("campaign", "nft_batch_minted")` summary event instead of one event
per contributor.

#### `safe_calculate_progress`

```rust
pub fn safe_calculate_progress(
    current_amount: i128,
    goal: i128,
) -> Result<u32, ContractError>
```

Returns all contributions when the deadline has passed and the goal was not met.

> **Deprecated** as of contract v3. Use `refund_single` instead.

### Parameter Validation Functions

---

### `refund_single`

```rust
fn refund_single(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Pull-based refund for a single contributor. Preferred over `refund` for gas
safety with large contributor lists.

**Errors:** `CampaignStillActive`, `GoalReached`, `NothingToRefund`

---

### `cancel`

```rust
pub fn validate_deadline(
    env: &Env,
    deadline: u64,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Creator cancels the campaign early. Sets status to `Cancelled`.

**Panics:** not active, not authorized

- Returns `CampaignEnded` if deadline is in the past or current
- Checks against maximum campaign duration (1 year)

#### `validate_goal`

```rust
pub fn validate_goal(goal: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Replaces the contract WASM without changing its address or storage. Only the
`admin` set at initialization can call this.

- Returns `GoalNotReached` for zero or negative goals

#### `calculate_platform_fee`

```rust
pub fn calculate_platform_fee(
    amount: i128,
    fee_bps: u32,
) -> Result<i128, ContractError>
```

Updates campaign metadata. Only callable by the creator while `Active`. Pass
`None` to leave a field unchanged.

- Fee BPS should be 0-10000
- Uses checked arithmetic

#### `validate_bonus_goal`

```rust
pub fn validate_bonus_goal(
    bonus_goal: i128,
    primary_goal: i128,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Configures the NFT contract used for contributor reward minting on successful
withdrawal. Only the creator can call this.

---

### `add_stretch_goal` / `add_roadmap_item`

```rust
fn add_stretch_goal(env: Env, milestone: i128)
fn add_roadmap_item(env: Env, date: u64, description: String)
```

Append stretch goals and roadmap items. Creator-only.

Strict validation of campaign state before operations:
1. Status check occurs first
2. Input validation follows
3. Timing checks last

This order ensures consistent error reporting and prevents state confusion attacks.

| Function | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `total_raised` | `i128` | Total tokens contributed so far |
| `goal` | `i128` | Primary funding goal |
| `deadline` | `u64` | Campaign end timestamp |
| `min_contribution` | `i128` | Minimum contribution amount |
| `contribution(addr)` | `i128` | Contribution by a specific address |
| `contributors` | `Vec<Address>` | All contributor addresses |
| `bonus_goal` | `Option<i128>` | Optional bonus goal threshold |
| `bonus_goal_reached` | `bool` | Whether bonus goal has been met |
| `bonus_goal_progress_bps` | `u32` | Bonus goal progress in basis points (0–10,000) |
| `current_milestone` | `i128` | Next unmet stretch goal (0 if none) |
| `get_stats` | `CampaignStats` | Aggregate stats |
| `version` | `u32` | Contract version (currently 3) |

Time-based guards use strict inequality comparisons:
- `timestamp > deadline` for pledge operations (deadline is exclusive)
- `timestamp <= deadline` for collection operations (must wait until after)

### Goal Verification

Ensures pledges are only collected when goals are met:
- Combined totals are atomically validated
- Overflow protection on total calculations
- Strict comparison against goal

```rust
pub struct CampaignStats {
    pub total_raised: i128,
    pub goal: i128,
    pub progress_bps: u32,        // 0–10,000 (basis points)
    pub contributor_count: u32,
    pub average_contribution: i128,
    pub largest_contribution: i128,
}
```

### `ContractError`

| Code | Variant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | Initialize called more than once |
| 2 | `CampaignEnded` | Action attempted after deadline |
| 3 | `CampaignStillActive` | Action requires deadline to have passed |
| 4 | `GoalNotReached` | Withdraw/collect attempted when goal not met |
| 5 | `GoalReached` | Refund attempted when goal was met |
| 6 | `Overflow` | Integer overflow in calculations |
| 7 | `NothingToRefund` | Caller has no contribution to refund |
| 8 | `ZeroAmount` | Amount is zero |
| 9 | `BelowMinimum` | Amount is below minimum contribution |
| 10 | `CampaignNotActive` | Campaign is not in active state |

## Testing

- Test coverage target remains 95%+ lines in the crowdfund module.
- Critical code paths covered:
  - `initialize`: repeated init, platform fee bounds, bonus goal guard.
  - `contribute`: minimum amount guard, deadline guard, aggregation, overflow protection.
  - `pledge` / `collect_pledges`: state transition and transfer effect.
  - `withdraw`: deadline, goal check, platform fee, NFT mint flow.
  - `refund`, `cancel`, `add_roadmap_item`, `add_stretch_goal`, `current_milestone`, `get_stats`, `bonus_goal`.
  - `upgrade`: admin-only authorization.
  - `stellar_token_minter.test.rs`: explicit security/readability tests for
    deadline guards, goal guards, bonus-goal capping, and upgrade auth.

## Security Invariants

| Topic | Data | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `("campaign", "contributed")` | `(contributor, amount)` | `contribute` |
| `("campaign", "pledged")` | `(pledger, amount)` | `pledge` |
| `("campaign", "pledges_collected")` | `total_pledged` | `collect_pledges` |
| `("campaign", "bonus_goal_reached")` | `bonus_goal` | `contribute` (once) |
| `("campaign", "withdrawn")` | `(creator, payout, nft_count)` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "fee_transferred")` | `(platform_addr, fee)` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "nft_batch_minted")` | `minted_count` | `withdraw` |
| `("campaign", "roadmap_item_added")` | `(date, description)` | `add_roadmap_item` |
| `("metadata_updated", creator)` | `Vec<Symbol>` of updated fields | `update_metadata` |

---

## Security Assumptions

1. `creator.require_auth()` and `admin.require_auth()` provide access control.
2. Platform fee is validated ≤ 10,000 bps (100%) at initialization.
3. Bonus goal must exceed primary goal — validated at initialization.
4. `contribute` uses `checked_add` on all numeric accumulation → `Overflow` error.
5. NFT mint loop breaks at `MAX_MINT_BATCH` — caps event emission and gas.
6. `emit_batch_summary` is a no-op when `count == 0` or budget exhausted.
7. Refunds use checks-effects-interactions: storage zeroed before token transfer.
8. No reentrancy surface: Soroban's execution model does not support reentrancy.
