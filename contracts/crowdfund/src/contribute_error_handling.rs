//! contribute() error handling — typed errors and diagnostic helpers.
//!
//! @title   ContributeErrorHandling
//! @notice  Centralizes error codes and helpers for the `contribute()` entry
//!          point. All error conditions are represented as typed `ContractError`
//!          variants; this module re-exports their numeric codes so off-chain
//!          scripts can map raw codes to human-readable descriptions without
//!          embedding magic numbers.
//!
//! # Error taxonomy for `contribute()`
//!
//! | Code | Variant              | Trigger                                          |
//! |------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! |  2   | `CampaignEnded`      | `ledger.timestamp > deadline`                    |
//! |  6   | `Overflow`           | contribution or total_raised would overflow      |
//! | 14   | `ZeroAmount`         | `amount == 0`                                    |
//! | 15   | `BelowMinimum`       | `amount < min_contribution`                      |
//! | 16   | `CampaignNotActive`  | campaign status is not `Active`                  |
//! | 17   | `NegativeAmount`     | `amount < 0`                                     |
//!
//! # Security assumptions
//!
//! - `contributor.require_auth()` is called before any state mutation.
//! - Negative amounts are rejected before zero/minimum checks.
//! - Campaign status is checked first; cancelled/succeeded campaigns are
//!   rejected before any other validation.
//! - Overflow is caught with `checked_add` on both per-contributor and global totals.
//! - The deadline check uses strict `>`, so contributions at exactly the
//!   deadline timestamp are accepted.
