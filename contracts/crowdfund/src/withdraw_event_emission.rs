//! Bounded `withdraw()` Event Emission Module
//!
//! This module provides the logic for capped NFT minting during campaign withdrawal.
//! It prevents unbounded gas consumption by limiting the number of NFT mints per
//! `withdraw()` call and emits a single summary event instead of many individual events.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Gas Efficiency**: Caps NFT minting at `MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH` per withdrawal
//! - **Event Optimization**: Emits single batch event instead of O(n) individual events
//! - **UX Improvement**: Provides comprehensive withdrawal data including NFT mint count
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This module is used by the main crowdfund contract's `withdraw()` function.
//! The [`mint_nfts_in_batch`] function handles all NFT minting logic with proper
//! event emission and gas consumption limits.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::withdraw_event_emission::mint_nfts_in_batch;
//!
//! fn withdraw_impl(env: &Env) -> u32 {
//!     let nft_contract = env.storage().instance().get::<_, Address>(&DataKey::NFTContract);
//!     let minted_count = mint_nfts_in_batch(env, &nft_contract);
//!     // ... continue with withdrawal ...
//!     minted_count
//! }
//! ```

/// Mint NFTs to eligible contributors in a single batch.
///
/// Processes at most `MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH` contributors per call to prevent
/// unbounded gas consumption. Emits a single `nft_batch_minted` summary event
/// with the total count of NFTs minted.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `env`: The Soroban environment
/// - `nft_contract`: Optional address of the NFT contract to mint to contributors
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The number of NFTs minted in this batch (0 if no NFT contract or no eligible contributors).
///
/// # Events Emitted
///
/// - `("campaign", "nft_batch_minted")` with `u32` count (only when > 0 minted)
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// - Contributors beyond the cap are NOT permanently skipped - they can be minted
///   in subsequent `withdraw()` calls if the campaign owner calls withdraw again.
/// - The cap is a compile-time constant. Changing it requires a contract upgrade.
/// - This function assumes the NFT contract has a `mint` function that accepts
///   `(Address, u64)` as arguments (recipient, token_id).
///
/// # Performance
///
/// - Time Complexity: O(min(n, MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH)) where n is contributor count
/// - Space Complexity: O(1) - uses constant extra space
/// - Event Emission: O(1) - single batch event instead of O(n) individual events
///
/// # Edge Cases
///
/// - When `nft_contract` is `None`: returns 0, emits no events
/// - When no eligible contributors (all have 0 contribution): returns 0, emits no batch event
/// - When exactly `MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH` contributors: mints exactly that many
/// - When > `MAX_NFT_MINT_BATCH` contributors: caps at MAX, allows remaining to be minted later
