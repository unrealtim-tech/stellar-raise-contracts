//! # campaign_goal_minimum
//!
//! @title   CampaignGoalMinimum — Extracted constants and enforcement logic
//!          for campaign goal and minimum contribution threshold validation.
//!
//! @notice  This module centralizes every magic number and threshold used
//!          during campaign initialization and contribution validation.
//!          Extracting them into named constants eliminates repeated literals
//!          scattered across the contract, reduces the risk of inconsistent
//!          values, and makes the intent of each guard immediately clear to
//!          reviewers.
//!
//! @dev     All constants are `pub` so that `lib.rs` and test modules can
//!          import them from a single source of truth.  No runtime state is
//!          held here — this module is purely compile-time constants plus
//!          pure validation helpers.
//!
//! ## Gas-efficiency rationale
//!
//! Before this refactor the contract contained inline literals such as
//! `10_000` (fee cap in bps), `0` (zero-amount guard), and the minimum-goal
//! floor.  Each occurrence forced the reader to infer intent from context and
//! made audits error-prone.  Named constants:
//!
//! - Are resolved at compile time — zero runtime cost.
//! - Appear in a single place, so a future change touches one line.
//! - Enable the compiler to catch type mismatches at the call site.
//!
//! ## Security assumptions
//!
//! 1. `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` prevents campaigns with a zero or trivially small
//!    goal that could be exploited to immediately trigger "goal reached" and
//!    allow the creator to withdraw dust amounts.
//! 2. `MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT` prevents zero-amount contributions that waste
//!    gas on a no-op token transfer and pollute the contributors list.
//! 3. `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS` caps the platform fee at 100 % (10 000 bps) so
//!    the contract can never be configured to steal all contributor funds.
//! 4. `PROGRESS_BPS_SCALE` is the single authoritative scale factor for all
//!    basis-point progress calculations; using it everywhere prevents
//!    off-by-one errors when the scale changes.
//! 5. `MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET` ensures the campaign deadline is always in the
//!    future relative to the ledger timestamp at initialization, preventing
//!    campaigns that are dead-on-arrival.
//!
//! ## Validation flow
//!
