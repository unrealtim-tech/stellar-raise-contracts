# Campaign Goal Minimum Threshold Enforcement — Security Refactor

## Overview

The `campaign_goal_minimum` module enforces a minimum financial goal for every
new crowdfunding campaign before it can be initialized on-chain.  It also
provides all other scalar validation helpers used by `initialize()` so that
every parameter check lives in one auditable, testable location.

### Why this enforcement is necessary

Without a minimum goal floor, the contract would accept campaigns with a goal
of zero or one token unit.  This creates several problems at scale:

- **Ledger bloat** — Each campaign occupies at least one persistent ledger
  entry.  Dust campaigns (goal ≈ 0) provide no economic value but consume the
  same storage as legitimate campaigns.
- **Immediate drain exploit** — A zero-goal campaign is "successful" the
  moment any contribution arrives.  The creator can call `withdraw()` instantly,
  turning the contract into a trivial donation drain with no accountability.
- **Spam / griefing** — Without a floor, an adversary can flood the factory
  with thousands of worthless campaigns at minimal cost, degrading indexer and
  frontend performance for all users.

Setting `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT = 1` is deliberately permissive for test environments
while still closing the zero-goal attack surface.

## Constants

| Constant                  | Value  | Meaning                                          |
|---------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT`         | 1      | Smallest accepted campaign goal (token units)    |
| `MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT` | 1      | Smallest accepted `min_contribution`             |
| `MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET`     | 60     | Seconds a deadline must be ahead of `now`        |
| `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS`    | 10_000 | 100 % in basis points — hard fee cap             |
| `PROGRESS_BPS_SCALE`      | 10_000 | Denominator for basis-point progress             |
| `MAX_PROGRESS_BPS`        | 10_000 | Maximum value returned by `compute_progress_bps` |

All constants are defined in `contracts/crowdfund/src/campaign_goal_minimum.rs`
and baked into the WASM binary at compile time.

### Updating a threshold

Because constants are baked into the WASM binary, changing them requires a
contract upgrade:

1. Update the constant in `campaign_goal_minimum.rs`.
2. Build the new WASM:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p crowdfund
   ```
3. Upload and upgrade via the admin mechanism (see
   `contracts/crowdfund/admin_upgrade_mechanism.md`).

> **Governance note** — If the project adopts on-chain governance, thresholds
> can be moved to contract storage (e.g. `DataKey::MinGoalAmount`) and updated
> via a governance proposal without a full upgrade.  The `validate_goal_amount`
> function signature already accepts `&Env` for exactly this future extension.

## API Reference

### `validate_goal(goal: i128) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

Off-chain / tooling helper.  Returns a descriptive string error instead of
`ContractError` to avoid pulling in the full contract dependency.

### `validate_goal_amount(_env: &Env, goal_amount: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>`

On-chain enforcement entry point.  Returns `ContractError::GoalTooLow` (code 18)
when `goal_amount < MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT`.

### `validate_min_contribution(min_contribution: i128) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

Validates that `min_contribution >= MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT`.

### `validate_deadline(now: u64, deadline: u64) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

Validates that `deadline >= now + MIN_DEADLINE_OFFSET`.  Uses `saturating_add`
to prevent overflow when `now` is near `u64::MAX`.

### `validate_platform_fee(fee_bps: u32) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

Validates that `fee_bps <= MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_BPS`.

### `compute_progress_bps(total_raised: i128, goal: i128) -> u32`

Returns campaign progress in basis points (0–10 000).  Guards against
division by zero and caps at `MAX_PROGRESS_BPS` for over-funded campaigns.

## Integration

### On-chain usage in `initialize()`

```rust
use crate::campaign_goal_minimum::validate_goal_amount;

pub fn initialize(env: Env, goal: i128, /* … */) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    // Reject below-threshold goals atomically — no side-effects on failure.
    validate_goal_amount(&env, goal)?;
    // … rest of initialization
    Ok(())
}
```

### `validate_min_contribution(min_contribution: i128) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

Rejects `min_contribution < MIN_CONTRIBUTION_AMOUNT`.

```rust
use crowdfund::campaign_goal_minimum::validate_goal;

### `validate_platform_fee(fee_bps: u32) -> Result<(), &'static str>`

### TypeScript / JavaScript (Stellar SDK)

```typescript
const ERROR_CODES: Record<number, string> = {
  18: "Campaign goal is below the minimum threshold",
};

try {
  await contract.initialize({ goal, /* … */ });
} catch (e) {
  const code = e?.errorCode as number | undefined;
  console.error(code ? ERROR_CODES[code] ?? "Unknown error" : e);
}
```

### `compute_progress_bps(total_raised: i128, goal: i128) -> u32`

| Assumption | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dust campaign prevention** | `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT >= 1` ensures every campaign has a non-trivial economic commitment, preventing ledger-entry spam. |
| **No integer overflow** | The validation is a single signed comparison (`goal_amount < MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT`). No arithmetic is performed, so overflow is impossible regardless of the input value. |
| **Negative goal rejection** | `i128` can represent negative values. The `< MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` check (where `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT = 1`) rejects all negative and zero goals without a separate branch. |
| **Atomic rejection** | `validate_goal_amount` is called before any `env.storage()` writes in `initialize()`. A rejected goal produces no ledger mutations — the transaction reverts cleanly. |
| **Upgrade safety** | All contract storage and state persist across WASM upgrades. Raising `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` in a new binary does not affect already-initialized campaigns; it only applies to new `initialize()` calls. |
| **Discriminant stability** | `ContractError::GoalTooLow = 18` is stable across upgrades. Off-chain scripts that map numeric codes to messages will continue to work. |
